Like a fish out of water, he struggled to adapt to the corporate culture, his attempts at collaboration falling flat. His manager, a snake in the grass, seemed to be secretly undermining his efforts, poisoning the team's morale with subtle criticisms. The project, a ticking time bomb, was on the verge of exploding, its complex issues brushed aside in the rush to meet the deadline."
